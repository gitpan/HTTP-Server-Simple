   [rt.cpan.org #21727] [PATCH] Support for Perl 5.004
    -- SÃ©bastien Aperghis-Tramoni 

0.19

  Catch and ignore SIGPIPE, so broken pipes from the client don't cause 
  Standalone to drop all the way back to the shell.

0.20

  Require POSIX only if we need it, rather than "use" it all the time
  [cpan #17533] - Brad Bowman

0.18

  new method: valid_http_method() from Chris Dent to make it easier to 
  create servers handling non-standard HTTP verbs.

0.17
  Workaround for Class::Spiffy classloading order issue
  Better handling for completely mangled requests.

0.16 Mon Nov  7 14:40:43 EST 2005

  SIG{'HUP'} does not exist on Win32 (cpan #15606)

0.15 Thu Oct  6 21:11:02 EDT 2005

  Precompute the local host's hostname and IP to save on DNS lookups at runtime 

0.14 Thu Oct  6 20:48:49 EDT 2005

  Split out HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI::Environment to support non-CGI.pm CGIs
  Ignore SIGPIPE
  
  Signal handlers are now installed on ->run, not on new. Also, they're 
  documented. Thanks to Mark Fowler.
 
  We no longer lookup $ENV{'REMOTE_HOST'} by hostname, as it can cause huge performance problems.

0.13 Tue Aug  9 21:25:20 EDT 2005

  Signal handlers should be 'localed', so as not to mess with others' 
  code. -- Thanks to David Wheeler

- New public subclass-overridable method ->net_server() that can
  optionally take a Net::Server subclass name and use it to replace
  the default ->run() method. -- Autrijus Tang

0.04 Tue Mar 22 23:34:36 CST 2005
