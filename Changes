 * New restartability support from Mark Stosberg

    After reviewing the code in HTTP::Server::Simple,
    Catalyst::Engine::HTTP and HTTP::Server::Brick, I found and
    implemented an updated signal handling approach that I like and
    understand, and actually works.

    The current code restarted immediately if a SIGHUP came in, no
    matter what was happening, including if a request was in process of
    being fulfilled.

    The new code works more like "apachectl graceful". It waits for the
    current request cycle to finish, and then restarts the server.

    This code has to be integrated in the core, but its just about
    the same amount of signal handling code that was there... it just
    works better.  It's also written in such a way I think subclass/mixin
    authors could rewrite just these parts if they wanted.

    Also, it looks like a Net::Server based sub-class would already be
    doing its own thing with SIGHUP handling, and should continue to
    be unaffected.

 * 0.26 release apparently didn't get to cpan correctly

0.26
 
  * Supports multi-line encoded values in query_sting (like foo%0Abar) -- Dobrica Pavlinusic 
  * Fixes to URI unescaping to behave like apache does
0.24

  * Hopefully deal with an odd case where a poorly behaved Internet Explorer could crash the server.
    Thanks to the Catalyst project.

0.23
  Fix a release-engineering messup. Thanks to ANDK

   [rt.cpan.org #21727] [PATCH] Support for Perl 5.004
    -- SÃ©bastien Aperghis-Tramoni 

0.19

  Catch and ignore SIGPIPE, so broken pipes from the client don't cause 
  Standalone to drop all the way back to the shell.

0.20

  Require POSIX only if we need it, rather than "use" it all the time
  [cpan #17533] - Brad Bowman

0.18

  new method: valid_http_method() from Chris Dent to make it easier to 
  create servers handling non-standard HTTP verbs.

0.17
  Workaround for Class::Spiffy classloading order issue
  Better handling for completely mangled requests.

0.16 Mon Nov  7 14:40:43 EST 2005

  SIG{'HUP'} does not exist on Win32 (cpan #15606)

0.15 Thu Oct  6 21:11:02 EDT 2005

  Precompute the local host's hostname and IP to save on DNS lookups at runtime 

0.14 Thu Oct  6 20:48:49 EDT 2005

  Split out HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI::Environment to support non-CGI.pm CGIs
  Ignore SIGPIPE
  
  Signal handlers are now installed on ->run, not on new. Also, they're 
  documented. Thanks to Mark Fowler.
 
  We no longer lookup $ENV{'REMOTE_HOST'} by hostname, as it can cause huge performance problems.

0.13 Tue Aug  9 21:25:20 EDT 2005

  Signal handlers should be 'localed', so as not to mess with others' 
  code. -- Thanks to David Wheeler

0.12 Sun Jul 17 02:14:57 EDT 2005

  Test suite improvements from Mattia Barbon

0.11 Fri Jul  8 22:56:01 EDT 2005
  Bogus META.yml broke signature checks. Thanks to sungo.

0.10 Tue Jun 28 11:27:58 EDT 2005

- Allow separate treatment of STDIN and STDOUT handles to the server.  This
  gives support for HTTP::Server::Simple::Recorder.

- Fix a bug in HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI that clobbered CGI ENV variables
  in some cases. Thanks, Hide.
- New public subclass-overridable method ->net_server() that can
  optionally take a Net::Server subclass name and use it to replace
  the default ->run() method. -- Autrijus Tang

0.04 Tue Mar 22 23:34:36 CST 2005
- Changed ->headers calling conventions. This may break backwards compat,
  but is cleaner and safer.
- Fixed bugs in ::CGI that broke http header handling
- Refactored code to be more transparent
- Patch from Sebastian Riedel to do proper parsing of form data from STDIN
